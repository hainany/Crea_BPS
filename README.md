# Crea_BP
BP, a.k.a. bad poet project, is one of assignments of Leiden master course *Computational Creativity*. In this project I make use of LSTM for Japanese haiku poem entries generation. The report can be found [here](http://qaqawwv.nl/2020/11/02/ai-poet/).

The data is provided by the *haikurnn* project of [docmarionum1](https://github.com/docmarionum1/haikurnn/)
